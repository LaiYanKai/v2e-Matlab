# v2e-Matlab
A modified Matlab implementation of v2e. It does not include SlowMo interpolation as in the original work by the authors. The work is compared to a Python (Google Colab) version of v2e by the authors.
The PDF is rushed, so may contain many typos, but contain essential information about concepts, data and results.

One advantage over v2e's implementation include the interpolation (ad-hoc uniform random) of asynchronous shot noise events between the timestamps of two adjacent frames.
Additionally, if there are multiple events between these frames, each event fires evenly between these frames depending on the log luma values sampled at both frames.
These events appear to occur regularly between frames and not asynchronously in the authors' Python implementation. This may have been a bug, or that the slow motion interpolation is fast enough to eliminate the need to implement asynchronously (but only assuming if the user chooses slow motion interpolation).

Some samples can be seen here:

The videos are not clear but gives us a quick glance of the results.

For the snippets below, the left panel shows the source video; the middle shows the v2e Python (authors') results; and the right shows this work's Matlab implementation.

It may be possible to use optical flow methods in the slow motion interpolation to interpolate the resulting noise events directly.
